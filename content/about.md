I am a content developer based in [Ottawa](https://theplanetd.com/things-to-do-in-ottawa/).

Over the last decade, I’ve:

*   wrote and designed a wide variety of UX and technical content

*   developed and managed information architecture (IA) for several technical documentation

*   kept the end-user at the centre for all content development process

*   enjoyed working with some of the smartest individuals in the information and technology sector, and

*   developed a deep interest in the different ways people discover and process information

While I know you’ll be thrilled with the results, you’ll also really love how well we’ll work together.

I identify and understand the user and business needs, enjoy working with designers and developers, and value the importance of communicating clearly and consistently using meaningful language.

As a hobby, I create music and enjoying drinking Darjeeling tea.  I live in Ottawa with my wonderful wife and one toddler.
