I am a content developer based in [Ottawa](https://theplanetd.com/things-to-do-in-ottawa/). 

Over the last decade, I’ve:

*   wrote and designed a wide variety of UX and technical content

*   developed and managed information architecture (IA) for several technical documentation

*   kept the end-user at the centre of content development

*   enjoyed woking with some of the smartest individuals in the information and information sector

*   and developed a deep interest in the different ways people discover and process
    information


While I know you’ll be thrilled with the results, you’ll also really love how well we’ll work together.

Writing and improving digital content to support task completion with clear, concise and meaningful language


I identify and understand the user and business needs, enjoy working with designers and developers, and value the importance of communicating clearly and consistently with the team and stakeholders.

As a hobby, I create music and drink Darjeeling tea.  He lives in Ottawa with his beautiful wife and one toddler.
