I am a content designer and UX writer based in [Ottawa](https://theplanetd.com/things-to-do-in-ottawa/).

Over the last decade (and more), I’ve:

*   developed a deep interest in the different ways people discover and process information

*   wrote copy for variety of product interfaces from on-screen guides, error notifications and user onboarding to push notifications and tooltips

*   wrote and designed a wide variety of GUI and CLI based technical content

*   designed information architecture (IA) for web-based technical documentation

*   kept the end-user at the centre for all content development process

*   enjoyed working with some of the smartest individuals in the information and technology sector

I identify and understand the user and business needs, enjoy working with designers and developers, and value the importance of communicating clearly and consistently using meaningful language. Whether you need to update your existing communication materials or need someone to research, design, and write new content—I can help.

Other than developing technical information for [Solace PubSub+ products](https://solace.com/products/platform/), I create [Music](/music), drink an insane amount of Darjeeling tea, and spend time quality time with my family.
