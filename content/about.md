I am a content designer and UX writer based in [Ottawa](https://theplanetd.com/things-to-do-in-ottawa/).

Over the last decade (and more), I’ve:

*   developed a deep interest in the different ways people discover and process information

*   wrote and designed a wide variety of GUI and CLI based technical content

*   reviewed and wrote several user interface (UI) texts

*   managed information architecture (IA) for several technical documentation

*   kept the end-user at the centre for all content development process

*   enjoyed working with some of the smartest individuals in the information and technology sector

I identify and understand the user and business needs, enjoy working with designers and developers, and value the importance of communicating clearly and consistently using meaningful language. Whether you need to update your existing communication materials or yneed someone to research, design, and write new content—I can help.

Other than developing technical information for [Solace PubSub+ products](https://solace.com/products/platform/), I create [Music](/music).
