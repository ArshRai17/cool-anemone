  It's only when I am playing an instrument or singing, I can let go of
  everything else and just be in that moment.

As an introspective singer-composer, I love creating music that gives listeners a fresh perspective and an impression to ponder over. I enjoy combining funk, blues, jazz, reggae and rock with mellow Nepali folk and contemporary music.

My debut single, Yo Bato, was released on September 2021. A Nepali funk number that blends American funk with contemporary Nepali music.
