Music is food for my soul. Even when I am binging on Netflix or just sitting and musing over something, you will find me strumming my guitar or humming a tune.

As an introspective singer-composer, I ove a little quirk; I try to combine funk, blues, jazz, and rock with mellow Nepali folk and contemporary music. In February 2021, I released his first single, Yo Bato—a Nepali funk number with swanky bass lines, vocal harmonies, and punchy rhythm guitar. I love to compose music that gives a fresh perspective to listeners and an impression to ponder over.

I was born and brought up in Darjeeling, a picturesque town nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas. A town where music is an integral part of its people and culture, hence from a very young age, aRsh learnt of his affinity for melodic beats. He uncovered his passion for music from his youngest years, singing in the school choir and musical plays. Rock and metal music was the fad in those days, and he grew up listening to bands like Extreme, Dream Theatre, Europe, Mr. Big, Gary Moore, Eric Clapton, Audioslave, RATM and RHCP, to name a few. We are talking about the 90s and mixtapes here. Walking to school instead of taking a cab and saving up his lunch money to buy cassettes of these bands was something he did routinely. He would then create mixtapes of his favourite songs and listen to them loud in his room or his walkman when he would be out-and-about. 

From a small-town boy mixing tapes, I am now making my own music, taking inspiration from the bands that listened to growing up, but I still rooted to my background. I want to bring a mixed variety of styles that I experiment in my compositions and wish to timelessly combine various inspirations into seamless, catchy, and unique tunes. 

During my University days, I was drawn to Darjeeling’s local music scene, with bands playing a broad genre of music. I eventually developed a flair to learn guitar. MY first guitar was an acoustic Hofner, which my mother got for me. I would sit outside in the sun and practice for hours until my fingers hurt, or I would be in his room learning all day. Learning to play guitar with limited resources was complicated. It was all about listening and learning to play, spending endless hours looping my cassettes to understand a specific part of a song. Now when I look back, everything seems worthwhile because my passion only got stronger. 

In the late 90s and early 2000, blues and jazz were at the forefront of Darjeeling's music scene. Not surprisingly, my taste in music also transitioned to artists like  George Benson, Jaco Pastorius, Al Jarreau, John Scofield, Miles Davis, Dennis Chambers, Jamiroquai, La Chic, Funkadelic, Tower of Power, Incognito, and Charlie Hunter, and DAngelo, to name a few.

I moved to New Zealand (NZ) in 2007, where I spent a few years and reggae music caught my fancy. New Zealanders love reggae, and bands like Fat Freddy’s Drop, Trinity Roots, Kora, The Black Seeds, Katchafire, and Salmonella Dub were creating some fantastic music. There is a significant influence of NZ music in my upcoming song “Sinking in Love.” Around that time, I also listened to a lot of music from John Mayer, Jack Johnson, Ben Harper, Sade, Dave Matthews Band, Marvin Gaye, Bill Withers, Amos Lee, Norah Jones, and Paulo Nutini. I want to retain some of the old elements and styles that have created a musical safe space for me and want to make music for listening.

I had been sketching many ideas for songs but never really had a chance to explore them further. After an extended lockdown in Canada and working from home, I could squeeze in time for music. Exploring the theme of “YO BATO” was a big step for me. COVID came as a blessing in disguise as I had more time in hand, which I diligently used to record music. 

I am currently working on recording a few songs that I had roughly written years ago. I am also singing a few songs for Phil Rai, due to be released soon and playing guitar for a local Ottawa-based band called Rodhi Blues. I am based in Ottawa and record music in my home studio.
