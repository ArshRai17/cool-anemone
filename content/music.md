Music is food for my soul. Even when I am binging on Netflix or just sitting and musing over something, you will find me strumming my guitar or humming a tune.

I was born and brought up in [Darjeeling](https://www.incredibleindia.org/content/incredibleindia/en/destinations/darjeeling.html), a picturesque town nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, where music is an integral part of its people and culture. From his early days, aRsh sang in the school choir and regularly participated in various musical plays. Even in classrooms, his friends would always find him singing or humming tunes. He grew up listening to bands like Extreme, Dream Theater, Europe, Mr. Big, Motley Crue, Pearl Jam, Gary Moore, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Audioslave, RATM, RHCP, White Snake, Thin Lizzy, and Led Zeppelin. A mixed variety of styles that you will find in his compositions. 

From his early school days, his passion for music was clear—often walking to school instead of taking a taxi and saving his lunch money to buy cassettes. Yes, those ancient things where people recorded music. He would then create mixtapes of his favourite songs and listen to them loud in his room or his walkman when he would be out-and-about.

Later during his Grad school, he was deeply influenced by the local music scene, with bands playing a broad genre of music. It was at this time that he started learning guitar. His first guitar was an acoustic Hofner, which his mother got for him. He would sit outside in the sun and play for hours until his fingers hurt, or he would be in his room learning all day. In those days, using your ears was the only way to learn a song, spending hours rewinding and forwarding his cassettes to understand a specific part of a song. 

During the late 90s and early 2000, blues and jazz were at the forefront of Darjeeling's music scene. Not surprisingly, aRsh's taste in music also gradually moved towards likes of George Benson, Jaco Pastorius, Al Jarreau, Weather Report, John Scofield, Miles Davis, Trilok Gurtu, Dennis Chambers, Jamiroquai, La Chic, Funkadelic, Tower of Power, Incognito, Charlie Hunter, and DAngelo, to name a few. 

After moving to New Zealand (NZ) in 2007, where he spent a few years, reggae music caught his fancy. New Zealanders love reggae, and bands like Fat Freddy’s Drop, Trinity Roots, Kora, The Black Seeds, Katchafire, and Salmonella Dub were creating some fantastic music. There is a significant influence of NZ music in his upcoming song “Sinking in Love.” Around that time, he also listened to a lot of music from John Mayer, Jack Johnson, Ben Harper, Sade, Dave Matthews Band, Marvin Gaye, Bill Withers, Amos Lee, Norah Jones, and Paulo Nutini.


aRsh combines funk, blues, jazz, and rock with Nepali folk and contemporary music. In February 2021, he released his first single, Yo Bato—a Nepali funk number that's filled with swanky bass lines, vocal harmonies, and punchy rhythm guitar. In his upcoming project, he wants to compose music that gives a fresh perspective to things we often ponder over.
