  It's only when I am playing an instrument or singing, I can let go of
  everything else and just be in that moment.

As an introspective singer-composer, I love creating music that gives listeners a fresh perspective and an impression to ponder over. I enjoy combining funk, blues, jazz, reggae and rock with mellow Nepali folk and contemporary music.  In September 2021, I will be releasing my first single, Yo Batoâ€”a Nepali funk number filled with swanky bass lines, vocal harmonies, and punchy rhythm guitars.

I was born and brought up in Darjeeling and grew up listening to bands and musicians like Extreme, Dream Theatre, Europe, George Benson, Jaco Pastorius, Al Jarreau, Bill Withers, Prince, Miles Davis, RHCP, and Jamiroquai,  to name a few. We are talking about the 90s and mixtapes here. From a small-town boy mixing tapes, I now make my own music, taking inspiration from the bands that I grew up listening to yet staying close to my roots.
