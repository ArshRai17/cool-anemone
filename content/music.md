Music is food for my soul. Even when I am binging on Netflix or just sitting and musing over something, you will find me strumming my guitar or humming a tune.

I grew u listening to an array of genres from rock to pop, blues and jazz, reggae, Nepali folk, Bollywood, and Indian Carnatic fusion.  Growing up in a little town - beautiful [Darjeeling](https://www.incredibleindia.org/content/incredibleindia/en/destinations/darjeeling.html) - music was (still is) is the heart and soul of Darjeelingeys.  Imagine a town with Oxford library, British-style cottages, tea gardens, only baker within miles easy, and did fans of The Beatles.

The music I create is is influenced by everything around me. I hope that you will find something of interest in it.
