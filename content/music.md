Music is food for my soul. Even when I am binging on Netflix or just sitting and musing over something, you will find me strumming my guitar or humming a tune.

I try to combine funk, blues, jazz, and rock with Nepali folk and contemporary music. In February 2021, he released his first single, Yo Bato—a Nepali funk number that's filled with swanky bass lines, vocal harmonies, and punchy rhythm guitar. In his upcoming project, he wants to compose music that gives a fresh perspective to things we often ponder over.

I was born and brought up in [Darjeeling](https://www.incredibleindia.org/content/incredibleindia/en/destinations/darjeeling.html), a picturesque town nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, where music is an integral part of its people and culture. From my early days, I was part of the school choir and regularly participated in various musical plays. Even in classrooms, my friends would always find him singing or humming tunes. I didn't play any instrument at that time but loved singing and listening to music. I would often walk to school instead of taking a taxi and saved my lunch money to buy cassettes. Yes, those ancient things where people recorded music. I would then create mixtapes of my favourite songs and blasted them loudly in my room or my walkman if I was out-and-about.

Later in Grad school, I deeply influenced by Darjeeling's local music scene, where bands playing a broad genre of music - rock, jazz, blues, funk, and folk. It was at this time that I started learning guitar. My first guitar was an acoustic Hofner that my mother got for me. I would sit outside in the sun and play for hours until my fingers hurt, or I would be in my room learning all day. In those days, using your ears was the only way to learn a song; I would spend hours rewinding and forwarding cassettes to understand a specific part of a song. The first song I learnt was The Temple of the King by Rainbow.  

During the late 90s and early 2000, blues and jazz were at the forefront of Darjeeling's music scene. I was absolutely intrigued by musicians and bands like George Benson, Jaco Pastorius, Al Jarreau, Weather Report, John Scofield, Miles Davis, Antionun Carlo Jobim, Stevie Wonder,  Herbie Hancock, Trilok Gurtu, Dennis Chambers, Jamiroquai, La Chic, Funkadelic, Tower of Power, Incognito, Charlie Hunter, and DAngelo, to name a few. 

After moving to New Zealand (NZ) in 2007, where I spent a few years, reggae music really caught my fancy. New Zealanders love reggae, and bands like Fat Freddy’s Drop, Trinity Roots, Kora, The Black Seeds, Katchafire, and Salmonella Dub were creating some fantastic music. There is a significant influence of NZ music in my upcoming song “Sinking in Love.” Around that time, I also listened to a lot of music from John Mayer, Jack Johnson, Ben Harper, Sade, Dave Matthews Band, Marvin Gaye, Bill Withers, Amos Lee, Norah Jones, and Paulo Nutini.
