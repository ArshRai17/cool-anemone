  It's only when I am playing an instrument or singing, I can let go of
  everything else and just be in that moment.

My love for music started early in my life, shaping my artistic journey and igniting a lifelong passion that continues to fuel my love for music. My musical roots trace back to school choirs and concerts, where I spent countless hours practicing with friends, refining my craft, and discovering the magic of performance.

Growing up in Darjeeling, I was inspired by the vibrant music scene, drawn to a diverse spectrum of artistsâ€”from the soulful blues of B.B. King and Eric Clapton to the electrifying funk of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jamiroquai, as well as the progressive intensity of Pink Floyd and Dream Theater. While blues, jazz, funk, and rock form the foundation of my musical identity, I approach every genre with curiosity and an open heart and take what resonates within me. My time in New Zealand sparked a passion for reggae, adding a new layer to my artistic expression.

As a recording artist, I strive to create music that inspires listeners to embrace new perspectives. When I'm not in my home studio, I find joy in experimenting with guitar pedals or jamming with my bandmates at [The Bluestone Collective](https://www.facebook.com/TheBluestoneCollective/).
