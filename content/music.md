Music is food for my soul. Even when I am binging on Netflix or just sitting and musing over something, you will find me strumming my guitar or humming a tune.

I grew up listening to various genres from rock to pop, blues and jazz, reggae, Nepali folk, Bollywood, and Indian Carnatic fusion. Growing up in a little town nestled at the foothills of the Himalayas - beautiful [Darjeeling](https://www.incredibleindia.org/content/incredibleindia/en/destinations/darjeeling.html) - music was (still is) the heart and soul of every Darjeelingey. 

Imagine a town with an Oxford library at the town centre, British-style cottages, tea gardens, a heritage bakery that existed since the colonial days, and numerous ardent fans of The Beatles. Yep, it was pretty awesome growing up in the hills of Darjeeling, and going to rock concerts and blues/jazz nights at the pub has had a major influence on the way I love music.

The music I create is is influenced by everything around me. I hope that you will find something of interest in it.
