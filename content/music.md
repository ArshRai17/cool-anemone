  It's only when I am playing an instrument or singing, I can let go of
  everything else and just be in that moment.

I grew up in Darjeeling, surrounded by incredible music and talented musicians. The vibrant local music scene influenced me deeply, but I was also inspired by blues, jazz, and rock. I loved bands and artists like Extreme, Dream Theater, George Benson, Jaco Pastorius, Bill Withers, Prince, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Jamiroquai—definitely a mix from the 90s and those classic mixtapes! From a small-town boy making mixtapes, I now make my own music, drawing inspiration from all my old favorites while staying close to my roots.

As a singer-songwriter, I enjoy crafting music that offers listeners a fresh perspective and something to ponder. I love blending genres, mixing funk, blues, jazz, reggae, and rock with elements of Nepali folk and contemporary vibes. When I’m not recording music, you’ll likely find me jamming on guitar with my talented bandmates at [The Bluestone Collective](https://www.facebook.com/TheBluestoneCollective/). It's always a great time!
