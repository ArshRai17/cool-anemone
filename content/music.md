  It's only when I am playing an instrument or singing, I can let go of
  everything else and just be in that moment.

As an introspective singer-composer, I love creating music that gives listeners a fresh perspective and an impression to ponder over. I enjoy combining funk, blues, jazz, reggae and rock with mellow Nepali folk and contemporary music.

Born and brought up in Darjeeling, I grew up listening to bands and musicians like Extreme, Dream Theatre, Europe, George Benson, Jaco Pastorius, Al Jarreau, Bill Withers, Prince, RHCP, and Jamiroquai,  to name a few. We are talking about the 90s and mixtapes here. From a small-town boy mixing tapes, I now make my own music, taking inspiration from the bands that I grew up listening to yet staying close to my roots.
