  It's only when I am playing an instrument or singing, I can let go of
  everything else and just be in that moment.

I grew up in Darjeeling, surrounded by awesome music. I was influenced by bands and artists like Extreme, Dream Theater, Europe, George Benson, Jaco Pastorius, Al Jarreau, Bill Withers, Prince, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Jamiroquaiâ€”definitely a mix from the 90s and those classic mixtapes! From a small-town boy mixing tapes, I now make my own music, taking inspiration from all my old favorites while keeping it close to my roots. 

As a singer-songwriter, I love creating music that gives listeners a fresh perspective and an impression to ponder over. I like to blend genres, mixing in funk, blues, jazz, reggae, and rock with some Nepali folk and contemporary vibes. When I'm not recording music at home, you'll probably find me jamming on guitar with some talented pals at [The Bluestone Collective](https://www.facebook.com/TheBluestoneCollective/). It's always a great time!
