As an introspective singer-composer, I love a little quirk. I try to combine funk, blues, jazz, and rock with mellow Nepali folk and contemporary music. In February 2021, I released my first single, Yo Bato—a Nepali funk number with swanky bass lines, vocal harmonies, and punchy rhythm guitar. I love to compose music that gives a fresh perspective to listeners and an impression to ponder over.

I was born and brought up in Darjeeling, a picturesque town nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas; a town where music is an integral part of its people and culture. In my early days, I was drawn to rock and metal music and grew up listening to bands like Extreme, Dream Theatre, Europe, Mr. Big, Gary Moore, Audioslave, RATM and RHCP, to name a few. We are talking about the 90s and mixtapes here. Walking to school instead of taking a cab and saving up my lunch money to buy cassettes of these bands was something I did routinely. I would then create mixtapes of my favourite songs and listen to them loud in my room or my walkman. From a small-town boy mixing tapes, I am now making my own music, taking inspiration from the bands that I listened to growing up, but still rooted in my background.

During my university days, I had a certain interest in learning to play guitar. My first guitar was an acoustic Hofner, which my mother got for me. I would sit outside in the sun and practice for hours until my fingers hurt, or I would be in my room learning all day.  If I met anyone who played guitar better than me, I would immediately ask them to teach me the tips and tricks. In those days, learning to play guitar with limited resources was complicated. It was all about listening and learning to play, spending endless hours looping my cassettes to understand a specific part of a song. Now when I look back, everything seems worthwhile. 

In the late 90s and early 2000, blues, jazz, and funk were at the forefront of Darjeeling's music scene. Not surprisingly, my taste in music also transitioned to artists like  George Benson, Jaco Pastorius, Al Jarreau, John Scofield, Miles Davis, Dennis Chambers, Jamiroquai, La Chic, Funkadelic, and Charlie Hunter to name a few. In 2007, I moved to New Zealand (NZ) to pursue higher studies. New Zealanders love reggae, and bands like Fat Freddy’s Drop, Trinity Roots, Kora, The Black Seeds, Katchafire, and Salmonella Dub were creating some fantastic music. There is a significant influence of NZ music in my upcoming song “Sinking in Love.”

I had been sketching many ideas for songs but never really had a chance to explore them further. After an extended lockdown in Canada and working from home, I could squeeze in time for music. Exploring the theme for “YO BATO” was a big step for me. I am currently working on recording a few more songs that I had roughly written years ago. I am also singing a few songs for Phil Rai, due to be released soon this year and playing guitar for a local Ottawa-based band called Rodhi Blues. I am based in Ottawa and record music in my home studio.
