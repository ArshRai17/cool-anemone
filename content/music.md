  It's only when I am playing an instrument or singing, I can let go of
  everything else and just be in that moment.

As an introspective singer-composer, I love a little quirk. I try to combine funk, blues, jazz, reggae and rock with mellow Nepali folk and contemporary music. I love to compose music that gives a fresh perspective to listeners and an impression to ponder over. In October 2021, I released my first single, Yo Bato—a Nepali funk number with swanky bass lines, vocal harmonies, and punchy rhythm guitar.

I was born and brought up in Darjeeling and grew up listening to bands and musicians like Extreme, Dream Theatre, Europe, George Benson, Jaco Pastorius, George Bendon, Al Jarreau, Bill Withers, Prince, Miles Davis, Dennis Chambers, RHCP, and Jamiroquai,  to name a few. We are talking about the 90s and mixtapes here. From a small-town boy mixing tapes, I now make his own music, taking inspiration from the bands that he listened to growing up but still staying close to his roots.

 In 2007, I moved to New Zealand (NZ) to pursue higher studies. New Zealanders love reggae, and bands like Fat Freddy’s Drop, Trinity Roots, Kora, The Black Seeds, and Katchafire were creating some fantastic music. There is a significant influence of NZ music in my upcoming song “Sinking in Love.”

I had been sketching many ideas for songs but never really had a chance to explore them further. After an extended lockdown in Canada due to COVID, and working from home, I could squeeze in time for music. Exploring the theme for “Yo Bato” was a big step for me. I am currently working on recording a few more songs that I had roughly written years ago. I am also singing a few songs for [Phil Rai](https://www.instagram.com/philraiz/?hl=en), due to be released later this year and playing guitar for a local Ottawa-based band called Rodhi Blues. I am based in Ottawa and record music in my home studio.
