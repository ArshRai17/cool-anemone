*Ottawa, Ontario* — "Yo Bato" (This Road) is an ode to life, a journey with many milestones to reach and explore. It's a medley about one's growth, learning and experiences, beautifully entwined together in an uplifting song. No matter where the road (Yo Bato) takes us, we will always reach home. Home can be a warm embrace of your parents, the cooing of your baby, or the faces of your loved ones—these irreplaceable pleasures can be your milestones! “Yo Bato" is a rendition that immerses its listener in a soundscape.

The lyric, in a way, has a mellow feel to it; however, Arsh's love for funk and disco has led to creating a more upbeat tune. The harmonized chorus brings life to the lyrics, and the groovy drum beats and punchy bass lines feel spot on. The rhythm guitar is subtle and funky, and the synchronization of the piano and organ adds a nice texture to the song. The result is a transcendent mix of textures and splendid nuances of symphony laced together by stretching the limits of his artistic abilities.

Yo Bato was recorded in Arsh's home studio and mixed and mastered by [Oliver Wagner](https://www.facebook.com/soundtheorylab). Arsh hopes to create more music, venture out new possibilities and captivate listeners with finely layered tunes, graceful rhythms in the timeless musical tradition of his Himalayan roots and a musical connection that makes his tunes unique.

"Be open-minded and enjoy listening to a unique contemporary Nepali song. Take what resonates with you," Arsh says.
