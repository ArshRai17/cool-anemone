With the extended lockdown and working from home, I had some spare time in hand, which I diligently used to record some music. Exploring the theme of "YO BATO" was a big step, and recording and mixing the song was a huge learning experience for me. 

When I started recording this song, I was juggling full-time work, taking care of my baby boy, managing my social life, as well as home and the daily chores. All that with an ailing back. Did that rhyme? That said, I could not have managed it without my wife's support. She has been rock solid!

My day gets progressively busy with work and various things-to-do at home. To manage my time more efficiently, I used to wake up around 5 a.m. or earlier to record guitar, bass, and keyboard when baby Kai would be asleep. My recording process was something like this in a nutshell (with various caveats that we will not gt into at this time):

1.  Write the main tune

2.  Work on the hook, which could be the verse, chorus, or some instrument

3.  Work the bridge or any additional parts

4.  Get the entire song roughly sorted

5.  write the lyrics

6.  Record the vocals

7.  Finalize the overall song

8.  Mix and master

Given the baby situation, I quickly realized that recording the instruments was much easier than recording vocals. With the instruments, I could plug them into my amp, connect the amp to my computer, and then listen and record using headphones. The noise stays contained, and the baby sleeps fine. Recording vocals, on the other hand, was a different ball game. You see, I couldn't simply plug the jack into myself like the instruments :). I know, I know. I could've soundproof the room, but I still haven't reached there yet. Therefore, I had no option but to sing out loud. And getting the right vocals, that sweet spot, requires a good chunk of time to work on the tune itself. So, early in the morning and sometimes late at night (like, really late), when it would be all quiet on the baby front, I would carefully whisper the vocal parts on the microphone. Whispering the vocal parts was just to lay down the tune and harmonies.  Then, when Kai would wake up, and given I had some spare time, I would sneak into my workstation and record the vocals correctly. Please don't ask me how many takes I had to do to finalize it.

Once I completed the initial recording, I asked some friends for their feedback, especially my good brother/friend Phil. Their constructive feedback made a lot of difference, especially when I had reached a point of fatigue with my recording. I incorporated their excellent feedback, made the necessary changes, and sent the song again for review. I think I went back and forth with my esteemed reviewers a few times. Doing so, I realized that updating and improving your music is a never-ending process. You must stop at some point. The more you refine the song and add changes, the further it moves away from the tune and concept you had originally envisioned.  The other vital point to keep in mind is the have a timeline. If you don't have a timeline (can be tentative), you will work on one project for a very, very long time. The best approach is to set a rough deadline, complete your song, and move on to the next project.

The process of writing and composing music is very similar. You are stuck at first, then create the first draft, edit it or sometimes re-write it, then you edit it again. You come back to it and ask yourself - did I actually write/compose that? You write or edit it again. Once you are happy with it,  you hesitantly send it for a peer review. You anxiously wait for their feedback.  When you get the feedback, you realize the value of the second pair of eyes or ears. You incorporate the good feedback and have it ready for an editorial/sound engineer review. Yes, you have to finalize it at some point and know when to stop; otherwise, it will be a long cumbersome, dull process. Would you watch the same animate GIF all day long?  Of course not, that would madness, therefore the writing/music gets finalized and is sent to the editor/sound engineer. Obviously, the sound engineer does a lot more than an editor and there are a lot of creative aspects that cant' really be compared between music composition and writing, but the process is similar, in a way. The editor does his editorial magic and the sound engineer gives his technical and creative spin to your song. You trust them with your life. Ha!

After I forced myself to finalize the recording, I did a rough mix of the song and reached out to Oliver Wagner from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/soundtheorylab/" target="blank">STL Sound Theory Lab</a> for the final mix and mastering. Oliver was extremely patient with my numerous requests and did a fantastic job mixing and mastering the song. Oh man, the joy of listening to the final mixed and mastered version of a piece of music that you worked on for months is an absolute delight.

So that's pretty much it. A quick summary of all the jazz that I went through to record this song. Be open-minded and enjoy listening to unique contemporary Nepali music, and take what resonates with you.
