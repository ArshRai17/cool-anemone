4.  Write the lyrics

5.  Record the vocals

6.  Finalize the overall song

7.  Mix and master

After recording the instruments, I worked on the lyrics, which was one of the hardest parts of composing a song. It was harder because I had to write in Nepali, and sadly, my Nepali writing ability is weak, to say the least. Even when I was thinking about the lyrics, I was thinking in English. So, I would write something in English, translate it into Nepali, and then sing to make everything rhyme properly. I spent a lot of time writing those few lines. Once the lyrics were sorted, I had to sing and record them.

Given the baby situation, I quickly realized that recording the instruments was much easier than recording vocals. With the instruments, I could plug them into my amp, connect the amp to my computer, and then listen and record using headphones. The noise stayed contained, and the baby slept fine. Recording vocals, on the other hand, was a different ball game. You see, I couldn't simply plug the jack into myself like the instruments :). My first attempt to sing brought my wife rushing at my workspace with those big scary eyes. It was pretty scary! I know, I know. I could've soundproof the room, but I still haven't reached there yet.

Getting the right vocals, that sweet spot, requires a good chunk of recording time (it did for me at least). So, early in the morning and sometimes late at night (like, really late), when it would be all quiet on the baby front, I would carefully whisper the vocal parts on the microphone. Whispering the vocal parts was just to lay down the tune and harmonies. Then, when Kai would wake up, I would sneak into my workspace and record the vocals correctly, given I had some spare time. Please don't ask me how many takes I had to do to finalize it. 

Once I completed the initial recording, I asked some friends for their feedback, particularly my good friend/brother Phil. Their constructive feedback made a lot of difference, especially when I had reached a point of fatigue with my recording. I incorporated their excellent feedback, made the necessary changes, and sent the song again for review. I think I went back and forth with my esteemed reviewers a few times. Doing so, I realized that updating and improving your music is a never-ending process. You must stop at some point. The more you refine the song and add changes, the further it moves away from the tune and concept you had originally envisioned. The other vital point to keep in mind is the timeline. If you don't have a timeline (can be tentative), you will work on one project for a very, very long time. The best approach is to set a rough deadline, complete your song as per the anticipated deadlines, and move on to the next project. It is a creative process, and it can take longer, but setting a goal and timeline will help you complete it sooner rather than later.

After I forced myself to finalize the recording, I did a rough mix of the song. I then reached out to Oliver Wagner from STL Sound Theory Lab for the final mix and mastering. Oliver was extremely patient with my numerous requests and did a fantastic job mixing and mastering the song. Oh man, the joy of listening to the final mixed and mastered version of a piece of music that you worked on for months is an absolute delight.

So that's pretty much it. A quick summary of all the jazz that I went through to record this song. Be open-minded and enjoy listening to this unique contemporary Nepali music, and take what resonates with you.
