some point. The more you refine the song and add changes, the further it moves away from the tune and concept you had originally envisioned. The other vital point to keep in mind is the timeline. If you don't have a timeline (can be tentative), you will work on one project for a very, very long time. The best approach is to set a rough deadline, complete your song as per the anticipated deadlines, and move on to the next project. It is a creative process, and it can take longer, but setting a goal and timeline will help you complete it sooner rather than later.

After I forced myself to finalize the recording, I did a rough mix of the song. I then reached out to Oliver Wagner from STL Sound Theory Lab for the final mix and mastering. Oliver was extremely patient with my numerous requests and did a fantastic job mixing and mastering the song. Oh man, the joy of listening to the final mixed and mastered version of a piece of music that you worked on for months is an absolute delight.

So that's pretty much it. A quick summary of all the jazz that I went through to record this song. Be open-minded and enjoy listening to this unique contemporary Nepali music, and take what resonates with you.
