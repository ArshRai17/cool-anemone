With the extended lockdown and working from home, I could squeeze in time for music, which I diligently used to record the music. Exploring the theme of "YO BATO" was a big step, and recording and mixing the song was a huge learning experience for me. 

When I started recording this song, I was juggling full-time work, taking care of my baby boy, managing my social life, as well as home and the daily chores. All that with an ailing back. Did that rhyme? That said, I could not have managed it without my wife's support. She has been rock solid!

My day gets progressively busy with work and things-to-do at home, so I used to wake up around 5 a.m. or earlier to record guitar, bass, and keyboard when baby Kai would be asleep. Given the situation at home, I quickly realized that recording the instruments was much easier than recording vocals. With the instruments, I could plug them into my amp, connect the amp to my computer, and then listen and record using headphones. The noise stays contained, and the baby sleeps fine. Recording vocals, on the other hand, was a different ball game. You see, I couldn't simply plug the jack into myself like the instruments :). I had no option but to sing out loud.  Get the right vocals, that sweet spot, requires a good chunk of time to work on the tune itself. So, early in the morning and sometimes late at night (like, really late), when it would be all quiet on the baby front, I would carefully whisper the vocal parts on the microphone. Whispering the vocal parts was just to lay down the tune and harmonies.  Then, when Kai would wake up, and given I had some spare time, I would sneak into my workstation and quickly record the vocals correctly. Please don't ask me how many takes I had to do to finalize it.

Once I completed the initial recording, I asked some friends for their feedback, especially my good brother/friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/philraiz/" target="_blank">Phil</a>. Their constructive feedback made a lot of difference, especially when I had reached a point of fatigue with my recording. I incorporated their excellent feedback, made the necessary changes, and sent the song again for review. I think I went back and forth with my esteemed reviewers a few times. Doing so, I realized that updating and improving your music is a never-ending process. You must stop at some point. The more you refine the song and add changes, the further it moves away from the tune and concept you had originally envisioned.  The other vital point to keep in mind is the deadline. If you don't have a deadline (can be tentative), you will work on one project for a very, very long time. The best approach is setting a deadline, completing it on time, and moving on to the next project.

After I forced myself to finalize the recording, I did a rough mix of the song and reached out to Oliver Wagner from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/soundtheorylab/" target="blank">STL Sound Theory Lab</a> for the final mix and mastering. Oliver was extremely patient with my numerous requests and did a fantastic job mixing and mastering the song. Oh man, the joy of listening to the final mixed and mastered version of a piece of music that you worked on for months is an absolute delight.

So that's pretty much it. A quick summary of all the jazz that I went through to record this song. Be open-minded and enjoy listening to unique contemporary Nepali music, and take what resonates with you.
