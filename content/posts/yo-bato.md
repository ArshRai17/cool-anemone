"Yo Bato" means "This Road," and literally, Yo bato has taken me to all the unexplored roads, nooks and crannies of making music. Exploring the theme for Yo Bato was a big step, and the recording and mixing of the song was indeed a giant leap -- not for Mankind, but it was indeed for a professional writer like me ðŸ¤“.

When I first sat down to write this piece, I was a bit fidgety. Over the years, countless artists and musicians have talked about their journey and the perils of creating their masterpiece. Yo Bato is far from a masterpiece, but I remembered that I almost always learned something from other musicians' journeys whenever they shared their experiences.  As a UX and Tech writer, I think I wanted to share a little about my journey of making music and the familiar territories that I reached that I could compare with writing.

The process of composing music and writing a piece felt very similar to me. The uncanny resemblance of that experience hit me when I sat down staring at space with my guitar trying to come up with a tune. That very indistinguishable feeling dawns on me when I sit to write a piece, where I just stare at my blinking cursor. Not to sound pompous, but both these crafts need a lot of creativity and skills. I am learning, but both in writing and making music, you need practice. The more you write, and the more you make music, you learn and get better. 

Who said men can't multi-task? When I started recording this song, I was a part-time Nanny, working full-time, managing my social life, and all the daily chores that life demands - all that with an ailing back. Did that rhyme? To manage my time more efficiently, I used to wake up around 5 a.m. or earlier to record guitar, bass, and keyboard when baby Kai would be asleep. Once Kai was up, I admit that all I wanted (still do!)  was playing with him. Yep, you do go Ga Ga over your kid! Those big eyes, curly hair, chubby legs, and smiles and giggles easily make me weak on my knees. So my priorities were straight, but I also wanted to complete the song sooner rather than later. 

After recording the instruments, I worked on the lyrics, one of the hardest parts of composing a song. It was hard because I had to write it in  Nepali, and sadly, my ability to write in Nepali is not my strength. Even when I was thinking about the lyrics, I was thinking in English. Yes, that is right; colonialization did do a good job. I would write something in English, translate it into Nepali, and then sing to make sure everything rhymed properly. Once the lyrics were sorted, I had to record the vocals.

Given the baby situation, I quickly realized that recording the instruments was much easier than recording vocals. With the instruments, I could plug them into my amp, connect the amp to my computer, and then listen and record using headphones. The noise stayed contained, and the baby slept fine. Recording vocals, on the other hand, was a different ball game. You see, I couldn't simply plug the jack into myself like the instruments :). My first attempt to sing brought my wife rushing at my workspace with those big scary eyes. It was pretty scary! I know, I know. I could've soundproof the room, but I still haven't reached there yet.

Getting the right vocals - reaching that sweet spot - requires a good chunk of recording time; it did for me, at least. So, early in the morning and sometimes late at night (like, really late), when it would be all quiet on the baby front, I would carefully whisper the vocal parts on the microphone. Whispering the vocal parts was just to lay down the tune and harmonies. Then, when Kai would wake up, I would sneak into my workspace and record the vocals correctly, given I had some spare time. Please don't ask me how many takes I had to do to finalize it. 

Once I completed the initial recording, I asked some friends for their feedback, particularly my good friend/brother Phil. Their constructive feedback made a lot of difference, especially when I had reached a point of fatigue with my recording. I went back and forth with my esteemed reviewers a few times. Doing so, I realized that updating and improving your music is a never-ending process. You must stop at some point. The more you refine the song, the further it moves away from the tune and concept you had originally envisioned. The other vital point to keep in mind is the timeline. If you don't have a timeline (it can be tentative), you will work on one project for a very, very long time. The best approach is to set a rough deadline, complete your song as per the anticipated deadlines, and move on to the next project. It is a creative process, and it can take longer, but setting a goal and timeline will help you complete it sooner rather than later.

After I forced myself to finalize the recording, I did a rough mix of the song and reached out to Oliver Wagner from STL Sound Theory Lab for the final mix and mastering. Oliver was extremely patient with my numerous requests and did a fantastic job mixing and mastering the song. Oh man, the joy of listening to the final mixed and mastered version of a piece of music that you worked on for months is an absolute delight.

So that's pretty much it. A quick summary of all the jazz that I went through to record this song. Be open-minded and enjoy listening to this unique contemporary Nepali music, and take what resonates with you.
