***aRsh's debut single 'Yo Bato' *****explores new ideas musically and lyrically**


*Ottawa, Ontario*—The release of "Yo Bato" (This Road) is an ode to life, a journey with many milestones to reach and explore. aRsh traverses through groovy drum beats and punchy basslines to create a funky tune for a song with such profound depth to it. 

aRsh explores new ideas musically and lyrically in "Yo Bato." The song starts with a deep a d steady bass and upbeat drum beats, gradually blending vocal harmonies, rhythm guitar, piano, and organ without straying in one definitive genre. "Yo Bato" is a rendition that immerses its listener in a soundscape.

aRsh muses over life and talks about his journey and experiences in "Yo Bato" (His Road).

He ponders over the hope and despair of life, the mundane routine of making a living and surviving, sinking in the oblivion and failing to appreciate the simple joys of life.

aRsh's "Yo Bato" is a medley about his growth, learning and experiences beautifully entwined together in an uplifting song. No matter where the Road (YO BATO) takes us, we will always reach home. Home can be a warm embrace of your parents, the cooing of your baby, the faces of your loved ones. These irreplaceable pleasures can be your milestones!

The story behind the lyrics is finding purpose in the journey of life and living in the moment with high spirits, which is lucidly compiled in this lyrically-driven funk tune. The result is a transcendent mix of textures and splendid nuances of symphony laced together by stretching the limits of his artistic abilities.

> "The song is really close to my heart and holds a deep meaning. It had a mellow feel when I was writing it. However, my love for funk, disco, acidic jazz, etc., naturally led to creating a funk tune. I was skeptical whether the lyrics would complement the tune, but there is a beauty in irregularities too. I love quirks, and I enjoy the idea of experimenting. The harmonised chorus brought life to the lyrics, and the groovy drum beats and punchy bass lines felt spot on. The rhythm guitar is subtle and funky, and the synchronization of the piano and organ really added a nice texture to the song. Be open minded and enjoy listening to a unique contemporary Nepali song. Take what resonates with you." aRsh says.

Yo Bato was recorded in his make-do home studio and mixed and mastered by @Oliver. aRsh loves to take feedback from family, friends, and especially his friend/mentor, Phil Rai. It all came together with their love and support. aRsh is collaborating with Phil Rai on other songs, which will be released sometime this year. aRsh hopes to create more music, venture out new possibilities and captivate listeners with finely layered music, graceful rhythms in the timeless musical tradition of his Himalayan roots and a musical connection that makes his music unique.
