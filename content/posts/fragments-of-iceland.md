When you think about life, your journey, there are so many open ended, and unanswered questions that we often ponder over. We get caught up with so many things in life - career, finances, society, status, ambitions, and so on - that we forget to appreciate the simplest things that often give us the greatest joy and satisfaction. Like, holding your baby in your arms, spending time with your parents, or  hanging out  with your friends.  

As we think about our journey and wonder where the road will take us, we need to realize that as long as we have our loved ones with us, it doesn't really matter where we go. As aRsh was musing over these thoughts, the title for the song. Yo Bato (This Road) popped in his mind and the lyrics followed. Now, when you think about the philosophy and thought behind the lyrics, the music that immediately comes to your mind is probably acoustic, blues, folk, or maybe a slow rock. You wouldn’ think a philosophical lyric would work in a funk number. However, that’s where aRsh explores, experiments, and creates a nice package of lyrically-driven funk tune.



> Based on the lyrics, this song started to feel really heavy and philosophical. However, I love upbeat music; I love funk, disco, acidic jazz and stuff, so the tune I started working on, by default became funky. I was unsure whether the lyrics would work or not, but it did. The harmonized chorus really added life to the lyrics, and the groovy drum beats and punchy bass lines hit the right spot. The rhythm guitar is subtle and funky, and hints of piano and organ really added a nice texture to the song.

The song was inspired by people, everyday life, and the possibilities of doing things; doing things the way you want to without worrying about opinions or validation. It explores ideas, musically and lyrically. Be open-minded and enjoy a song that takes a unique approach to Nepali contemporary music. 


Yo Bato was recorded in his home studio, and mixed and mastered by @Oliver. For aRsh, getting constructive feedback from family, friends, and especially his friend/mentor, Phil Rai was critical. aRsh is collaborating Phil Rai on a number of other songs, which is due to be released sometime this year
