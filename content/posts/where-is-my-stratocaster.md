As I lie down, getting cuppings and electrical stimulation on my back, after the wonderful effects of WFH, my mind wanders about to my guitar. 

The best thing about COVID is impulse buying. No wonder online businesses never went bust. And, for a person who is impatient and impulsive, Fender's American Pro II Stratocaster sure looked like Jessica Rabbit working her charms. I need to give a little kudos to myself because I did help a lot of online businesses with my extravagant spending on music-related gadgets and then deciding to have a kid in these uncertain times. Voilà!  

I never knew what muslin clothes were, nor did I know that diapers came in sizes, but there I was juggling my Jessica Rabbit (Oh, the Fender, I mean) and diapers!! And thanks to the cookies, the one in the kitchen knows when I want one and the one on my browser knows what I exactly want. Anyhow, I am not here to talk about my impulsive buying habits, but rather the after-effects of impulsive buying and having to wait.

So, I finally decided to get a [Stratocaster](https://www.long-mcquade.com/209540/Guitars/Electric-Guitars/Fender-Musical-Instruments/American-Professional-II-Stratocaster--Maple-Fingerboard---Mystic-Surf-Green.htm). Yes, the name sounds like an intergalactic spaceship. Sadly, the waiting period to get a hold of just one Fender American Pro II Strat is so long that I feel the components get shipped from Mars. Since Richard Branson has already launched his Virgin Galactic, it would not surprise me at all if they say they are collecting unicorn tails for the strings, getting the wood from Narnia, or they got lost in the closet.

The ETA that Long & Mcquade kindly gave me is April 2022, and that's just estimated. When I break my fingers counting the months, it comes to a full nine months of WAIT. Which pretty much makes me revisit the time I had to wait for my baby boy to join this marvelous world. The wait for my child was exciting because I could see him during the ultrasound sessions and feel his movements. But, Long & Mcquade does not provide such services, where I could see the craftsman working on my guitar and me on the other side feeling emo looking at the craftsman strategically tying strings on my baby, I mean the guitar. It's too much to ask for, I know, but also makes sense when you agreed to wait for nine-long-months.  

Let's say the electric stimulation is helping my back, but it's messing with my head. I am grinning, while getting cupped, just thinking bout my guitar. I know I do have a little Drama Queen in me, but anything for a Strat. I am eager to get my hands on it, and that moment will be emotional for me. I might even end up looking like a beauty queen who just got crowned; or, maybe I will go through the same emo moments that I had in the labour room. Or, I might grow really old and die waiting for the dispatch date of an estimated time.

P.s. My wife and I were indeed blessed with a baby boy six months ago.
