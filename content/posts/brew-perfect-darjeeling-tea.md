> Life is too short to drink bad tea!

There are a few things in my life that I cannot live without, and Darjeeling tea is one of those delights.

The process of brewing a perfect cup of Darjeeling tea is simple, as long as you have the right tools. You will need:

*   Second flush Darjeeling tea (Sorry, I only drink the second flush!)

*   Temperature control kettle or a thermometer. I use Cusintart's 

*   Teaspoon

*   Tea Port

*   Teacup

*   Teapot with an infuser or a separate infuser for your cup. You can also use a regular teapot and use a tea strainer while serving.

*   Filtered water

Alright, let's brew some tea.
