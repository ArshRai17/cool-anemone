There are a few things in my life that I cannot live without, and Darjeeling tea is one of those delights. The process of brewing a perfect cup of Darjeeling tea is simple, but you will need a few things.

You will need:

*   Second or first flush Darjeeling tea. I only drink the second flush!

*   Temperature control kettle or a thermometer. I use <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B003WEAHUY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8\&tag=arshabhirai20-20\&creative=330641\&linkCode=as2\&creativeASIN=B003WEAHUY\&linkId=dc2f5a7b1d05c5d6f7c093b884592e2f" target="_blank">Cusintart's programmable kettle.</a> and I love it!

*   Teaspoon. You can <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B074L4MZRY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8\&tag=arshabhirai20-20\&creative=330641\&linkCode=as2\&creativeASIN=B074L4MZRY\&linkId=3e915dd2da8deeeefa237435acfa3be8" target="_blank">buy a nice one from Amazon.</a>

*   Teacup. I like to see the colour of my tea as it brews, so <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B078PFY9RV/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8\&tag=arshabhirai20-20\&creative=330641\&linkCode=as2\&creativeASIN=B078PFY9RV\&linkId=2156758695fede503f84a7908f787bf5" target="_blank">I love these teacups</a> for everyday use.

*   Teapot with an infuser or a separate infuser for your cup. You can also use a regular teapot and strain the tea before serving. <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07KXSDQ9G/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8\&tag=arshabhirai20-20\&creative=330641\&linkCode=as2\&creativeASIN=B07KXSDQ9G\&linkId=7cb182cbaa75ecea6ddc78c34583f37b" target="_blank">This teapot is perfect for two cups.</a>

if you are brewing one cup.

*   Filtered water. The chlorine in the tap water spoils the flavour.

*   Biscuits or cake (optional)

*Disclaimer: I am not a tea sommelier or tea taster; these opinions are based on my taste and many years of drinking Darjeeling tea.*

## Step 1: Boil filtered water

Unlike other black teas, Darjeeling tea is usually not fully oxidized; therefore, you must brew it at a lower temperature than other black teas. I would say start with 185ºF and go up to 200ºF. The best way to get the right temperature to brew your tea is to try a few settings and find the temperature that suits your taste. I like most of my Darjeeling tea at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. I have a friend who also loves Darjeeling tea, and he enjoys it at 190 degrees Fahrenheit. So, you have to play around with the temperature to find the right fit for your taste.

## Step 2: Prepare your tea leaves

While the water is boiling, get your tea leaves ready. If you are brewing a cup of tea, scoop out one and half a teaspoon of your favourite second flush (or first flush). Again, you may want to try out different amounts, but one and a half teaspoons per cup work out well. [I use this teaspoon](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B074L4MZRY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8\&tag=arshabhirai20-20\&creative=330641\&linkCode=as2\&creativeASIN=B074L4MZRY\&linkId=3e915dd2da8deeeefa237435acfa3be8).  If you're brewing the tea in a pot, use the same measurement - one and a half teaspoons per cup.

## Step 3: Brew your tea

Pour the boiled water into your cup or pot and let it brew for four minutes. Once again, brew-time for your tea depends on whether you like your tea strong or light. I like my tea strong and robust; it brings out the muscatel flavour and a nice after-taste. Therefore, I brew my tea between four to five minutes. My best advice is to sip your tea as it brews until you get the flavour you like. Note that brewing longer than five minutes will potentially create some bitterness.

## Step 4: Let it rest

After brewing your tea, let it rest for another minute. You will not get the flavour of the tea if it is too hot, and also letting it rest for a bit really brings out the flavour.

## Step 5: Enjoy your tea

Enjoy your tea with your favourite biscuit or cake. I love it with scones or shortbread.
