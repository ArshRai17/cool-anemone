There are a few things in my life that I cannot live without, and Darjeeling tea is one of those delights.

The process of brewing a perfect cup of Darjeeling tea is simple, as long as you have the right tools.

You will need:

*   Second or first  flush Darjeeling tea  I only drink the second flush!)

*   Temperature control kettle or a thermometer. I use [Cusintart's programmable kettle](https://www.amazon.ca/Cuisinart-CPK-17C-Programmable-Kettle/dp/B003WEAHUY/ref=asc_df_B003WEAHUY/?tag=googleshopc0c-20\&linkCode=df0\&hvadid=292943077607\&hvpos=\&hvnetw=g\&hvrand=11471943400949287925\&hvpone=\&hvptwo=\&hvqmt=\&hvdev=c\&hvdvcmdl=\&hvlocint=\&hvlocphy=9000686\&hvtargid=pla-305919859109\&psc=1) and I love it!

*   Teaspoon.

*   Teacup

*   Teapot with an infuser or a separate infuser for your cup. You can also use a regular teapot and strain the tea before serving

*   Tea infuser if you are brewing one cup

*   Filtered water. The chlorine in the tap water spoils the flavour.

*   Biscuits or cake (optional)

Alright, let's brew some tea.

## Step 1: Boil filtered water

The best way to get the right temperate is to try a few settings, I like my tea at 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  I have a friend, who also loves Darjeeling tea and he enjoys it at 190 degrees Fahrenheit. So you have to play around with the temperature to find the right fit for your taste. However, I think, anything above 200 degrees Fahrenheit will burn the leaves.

## Step 2: Scoop and measure your tea leaves

While the water is boiling, get your tea leaves ready. If you are brewing a cup of tea, scoop out one and half a teaspoon of your favourite second flush (it's probably time for the first flush too).  Again, you may want to try out different amounts, but one and a half teaspoons per cup works out quite well for me. If you're brewing the tea in a pot, use the same measurement - one and a half teaspoons per cup.

## Step 3: Carefully pour the boiled water into your cup/pot

Pour the boiled water into your cup or pot and let it brew for four minutes. Once again, brew-time for your tea depends on whether you like your tea strong or light. I like my tea a bit strong; it brings out the muscatel flavour and a nice after taste, so I brew my tea between four to five minutes. My best advice is to sip your tea as it brews until you get the flavour you like. However, brewing longer than five minutes will potentially create some bitterness.

## Step 4: Let it rest

I have found that after brewing your tea, letting it rest for another minute or so really brings out the flavour. It's just my personal opinion based on my experience.

## Step 5: Enjoy your tea

Enjoy your tea with a nice shortbread or a slice of your favourite cake.
