There are a few things in my life that I cannot live without, and Darjeeling tea is one of those delights.

The process of brewing a perfect cup of Darjeeling tea is simple, as long as you have the right tools. You will need:

*   Second flush Darjeeling tea (Sorry, I only drink the second flush!)

*   Temperature control kettle or a thermometer. I use Cusintart's

*   Teaspoon

*   Teacup

*   Teapot with an infuser or a separate infuser for your cup. You can also use a regular teapot and use a tea strainer while serving

*   Tea infuser if you brewing one cup

*   Filtered water. The chlorine in the tap water spoils the falvour.

*   Biscuits or cake (optional)

Alright, let's brew some tea.

## Step 1: Boil filtered water

The best way to get the right temperate is to try a few settings, I like my tea at 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  Likewise, I have a friend, who also loves Darjeeling tea and he enjoys his tea at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. However, I think, anything above 200 degrees Fahrenheit burns the leaves, so flavour may be lost. 

## Step 2: Put your tea leaves in the infuser

If you are brewing a cup of tea scoop out one and a teaspoon of your favour second flush. Again, you may want to try out different amounts, but one and a half teaspoons per cup work out quite well. If you brewing the tea in a pot, use the same measurement - one and a half teaspoons per cup.

## Step 3: Carefully pour the boiled water into your cup/pot

Pour the boiled water into your cup or pot and let it brew for four minutes. Once again, how long you want to brew your tea depends on whether you like your tea strong or light. I like my tea a bit strong, which brings out the muscatel flavour and after tastes, so I brew my tea between four to five minutes. My best advice is to sip your tea as it brews until you get the flavour you like. However, brewing longer than five minutes will potentially create some bitterness.

## Step 4: Let it rest

I have found that after brewing your tea, letting it rest for another minute or so really brings out the flavour. When you drink your tea hot, immediately after brewing, does not bring out its full flavour (just my personal opinion based on my experience).

## Step 5: Enjoy your tea

Enjoy your tea with a nice shortbread or a slice of your favourite cake.
