It seemed like only yesterday when my wife came running to me, holding those early pregnancy test strips. The strip had two red lines, which meant she was pregnant. "Hurray!" I reacted—well, I had to. Don't get me wrong. I was happy. I just didn't know how to react. The news didn't really hit me until I saw Dr. Sheppard pull our boy out in the labour room. A messy little baby boy, covered in some slimy stuff and crying loudly, "Waah, Waah." I have no clue why, but I found myself crying...balling! A completely new feeling; it just overcame my entire being.


Parenthood is a blessing—the ability to nurture life—so delicate and dependent, and seeing it grow and change every day. Your world changes completely, but it's a positive change. Yes, you will be tired, sleep-deprived, and tired again, but the joy and satisfaction of holding your baby will nullify all your pain and troubles. Your baby's first smile and giggles will take all your pain away.


After you birth a child, only then do you truly realize how much your parents love you, how much they may have sacrificed, and how much you mean to them. You also realize how much you love them too. Being a Dad, it also made me think retrospectively about being someone's child. As you grow older, your parents age along with you, but it's different for them. They become more vulnerable, childlike. They start looking up to you, start listening to you more, and seek your advice on many things. As your parents grow older, they need care and attention. It's a role reversal. How just in a moment our parents start looking up to us; taking our opinions, it's something that doesn't seem apparent immediately. They start acting like kids, and we constantly have to be behind their backs for something so petty as eating food on time. Making sure they take their medicine regularly and checking if they slept well. You make sure they are comfortable and that they have everything they need and want. You call them every day if you live far away from them because you miss them as much as they miss you.


Parenthood does not start with a child; that innate ability to nurture comes with anything. People only relate parenthood with a child, but that's not the case. You don't have to be a parent or birth a child to love or nurture someone, something. You can equally feel the same love and affection for any child or a being because love comes from within.
