  Hiking can sometimes involves bushwhacking and hiking is sometimes referred to
  as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest,
  undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing vegetation
  aside.

Finally, I get my hands on Darjeeling’s 2021 second flushes. Yay! I am so excited to write about these fine teas as much as I was excited to drink them. I drink teas from these estates regularly, but each new batch of tea tastes different with distinct differences in flavour, aroma and taste. It is something similar with the 2021 second flush as compared to the 2020  lot.

I will start with my staple and a favourite, Margaret’s Hope.

## Margaret's Hope Muscatel Second Flush 2021 (DJ178/2021 FTGF0P1)

The second flush from Margaret’s Hope tea garden is one of my staple. It’s one of those Darjeeling teas that has a distinct aroma, signature taste, and after taste that beautifully lingers around in your mouth. And, yet again, Margaret's Hope Muscatel Second Flush 2021 is exactly how I’d expect it to taste. One those Darjeeling teas that I want to keep drinking all day.

This 2021 second flush (DJ178/2021) from Margaret’s Hope tea estate has a lovely smoky aroma, so it was probably lightly toasted while being processed. The brew has a light golden color - simply beautiful to look at. It has that distinct Margaret’s Hope muscatel flavour and the after taste that lingers in your mouth. A tea that tastes better with every new sip. I love the way the smoky aroma hits your nostrils while you sip and muscatel flavour wraps your tongue and lingers in your mouth afterwards. A delectable tea that I would drink anytime.

## Okayti Premium Second Flush 2021 (DJ164/2021 FTGF0P1)

It’s my second time drinking Okayti Estate’s second flush. The first time I drank their tea, I didn’t find any distinct flavour; however, it’s a different  experience this time. I think I will buy it again.

This 2021 second flush (DJ164/2021) from Okayti tea estate has deep amber colour and a with sweet aroma. You will immediately feel the sweetness on your first sip with a light muscatel aftertaste. The sweetness of the tea lingers as you continue to sip this with a certain character from Okayti tea estate. An excellent tea to drink later in the afternoon or when you want to and some sweetness to your day.

## Jungapana Premium Second Flush 2021 (DJ63/2021 FTGF0P1)

Black tea from Jungpana tea estate is quite a sought-after tea and often demands a high price in the market. I had tried their second flush a few times before, but it never hit my palate. Last year, as I was buying my monthly stock of Darjeeling’s second flush, I saw Jungapana’s Summer Chinary on sale at Teabox. I decided to try it one more time. I liked it. This year I immediately got Jungapan’s 2021 second flush as soon as it was in the market. I bought it from Vahdam Teas this time. 

This 2021 second flush (DJ63/2021) from Jungpana tea estate has a subtle muscatel flavour, light aroma with a beautiful dark amber color. You will feel the subtle muscatel flavour wrapping your tongue and it gets better after every sip. Finish your cup with a big sip. A full-bodied tea that is great in the morning or afternoon.
