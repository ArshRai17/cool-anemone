As a Darjeelingey, I prefer getting my tea directly from Darjeeling. I ask my folks, once in a while, to send me teas, which is quite an involved process. They have to walk uphill all the way to the town, taste the tea, buy it,  pack it and then send it through a reliable courier service.  Therefore, I avoid troubling them, unless I really need to, and have been purchasing my tea from the following online retailers:

*   [Teabox](#teabox)

*   [Capital Tea](#capital-tea)

*   [Vahdam Teas](#vahdam-teas)

## Teabox

I have been regularly buying tea from Teabox, and I have had nothing but good experiences. They are based in Siliguri, West Bengal, which is a few hours away from Darjeeling. The entire experience, from their website and product to delivery and customer service, has always impressed me.

#### Website

I love their website, and the web experience is fun. I like that the images and feelings are focused more on the tea itself rather than having their brand on the face. A subtle, product-focused marketing is good marketing, in my humble opinion.
Seeing the colour of a brewed Darjeeling tea and the ability to hover your cursor on top of an image and quickly add the tea to your cart is handy and avoids extra clicks. They provide a detailed description of each tea and the tea's lifecycle - from the plucking date through to processing, sorting, vacuum packing, storing and shipping dates. Nice!

As a customer, you can provide comments and feedback for each tea, which is published in the comments section. However, I would be skeptical, as only positive comments are published. My last negative comment about a teaspoon I bought was not posted.

#### Tea Selection

As they deal directly with the tea estates (tea gardens), they always have a good inventory of tea, and the selection was even better this year (2021). I saw some of my favourite second flushes, Giddhapahar, Margarets Hope, Castletonton, Jungpaana, and Seeyok, on their website before any other sellers had it!

#### Tea Quality

Most teas that I’ve bought from Teabox have been excellent, with a few exceptions once in a while.

#### Price

They are price competitive, but I've noticed that this year's their prices were higher. Also, their courier service fee has increased quite a bit, which adds to your overall cost. However, if you purchase over $100, you qualify for free shipping.

You can pay using your credit card or through PayPal

#### Courier and Packaging

The teas are vacuum-packed, and storage pouches are provided for each tea you buy. They have minimal packaging and marketing materials, which I love. You can track your parcel, and the delivery is always on time. Also, you don’t have to pay any import tax/fees.

#### Customer Service

Excellent customer service. Prompt response.

## Capital Tea

My first experience with Capital Tea was disappointing as they misplaced my parcel and the delivery was delayed. I didn’t have any tea to drink for an entire 48 hours - imagine! Having said that, they are fine tea importers based in Toronto. Other than the first incident, my overall experience has been pretty good so far.

#### Website

They have a simple website, but it’s easy to navigate and find the products. The “New Arrivals” option is helpful to check what’s new on their inventory quickly. I also love the drag and drop option to add tea to your cart from the landing page directly.

#### Tea Inventory

They hold a decent variety of tea sourced from the popular tea estates in Darjeeling. I usually buy my favourites such as Castleton and Margaret's Hope from them. As they are based in Toronto, they do not always keep up with the latest seasonal batch. All the same, it's always handy to have a good inventory of Darjeeling tea just a few hours away from where you live - even if they're older stocks.

#### Tea Quality

Most teas that I’ve bought from Capital Tea have been excellent, with a few exceptions when I ventured out to lesser-known tea estates.

#### Price and Payment

They are price competitive and cheaper than Teabox and Vahdam Tea, given that their shipping fees are much lower. Also, if you purchase over CAD$60, shipping is free within Canada. I always get free shipping!

You can pay using your credit card or by calling them on the phone.

#### Courier and Packaging

The teas are packed and sent in a sealed storage pouch. They have minimal packaging and marketing materials, which I love. You can track your parcel, and the delivery is on time.

#### Customer Service

Not the best customer service. Their response time is slow, and you can never reach them on the phone.

## Vahdam Teas

Vahdam Teas is a Noida-based retailer and exporter of fine teas. I started buying from them this year (2021). My experience has been good so far, other than the import tax that I had to pay, which they resolved quickly.

#### Website

While they have a modern-looking website, I am not a fan of their navigation, especially the inability to filter Darjeeling's tea variety (First Flush vs the Second Flush). I only drink a second flush and prefer the ability to filter out the noise.  Vahdam Teas' website does not have that option, which means scrolling and paying attention to every black tea in their inventory. They highlight new arrivals with a tag, but it is still not helpful when you have to keep scrolling. If anyone from Vahdam Teas is reading this article, you guys need to add a filter and improve the navigation. If you guys need help, you can always reach out to me!

Also, you have to click a couple of times to add a tea to your cart, not the best experience. Furthermore, as compared to Teabox and Capital Tea, where you have the option to buy 100 grams or more, I have only seen 100 grams with Vahdam Teas.

#### Tea Inventory

They have a good variety of tea in their inventory but scrolling through all the teas they have in their inventory is painful (more whines about their website). 

#### Tea Quality

My first experience has been great. I recently bought Okayti, Jungpana, and Margaret's Hope second flushes from them and all the teas were excellent. Read my review about these teas at \[Review of Darjeeling's 2021 Second Flushes]\({{< ref "/review-of-darjeeling-tea-second-flush-2021" >}} "Review of Darjeeling's 2021 Second Flushes").

#### Price and Payment

They are price competitive and cheaper than Teabox, given that their shipping fees are much lower.
You can pay using your credit card or by calling them on the phone.

#### Courier and Packaging

The teas are vacuum-packed, and storage pouches are provided for each tea you buy. I was not impressed with the unnecessary packaging and marketing material that was included in the parcel. I guess that’s the reason why I had to pay the import tax. You can track your package, and the delivery was on time. Note that you may end paying import tax, but they will refund the amount if you reach out to their customer service.

#### Customer Service

Good customer service. I reached out to their customer service with my complaints about having to pay a high import tax, and they quickly resolved it with a refund.
