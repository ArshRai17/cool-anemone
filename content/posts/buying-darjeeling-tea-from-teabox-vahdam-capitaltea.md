As a Darjeelingey, I prefer sourcing tea directly from Darjeeling. I as my folks, once in a while, to send me teas, which is quite an involved process of walking all the way to the town, tasting the tea, buying it, and then sending it through a reliable courier service. Therefore, I avoid troubling them, unless I really need to, and purchase from the following online retailers:

*   Teabox

*   Capital Tea

*   Vahdam

## Teabox

I have regularly bought tea from Teabox and I have had nothing but good experiences. Their head office is based in Siliguri, West Bengal, which is a few hours away from Darjeeling. The entire experience, from the website and product through to delivery and customer service has always impressed me.

#### Website

I love their website and the web experience is fun. I like the fact that the images and feel is focused more on the tea itself rather than having their brand on the face. A subtle, product-focused marketing is good marketing in my humble opinion. 

Seeing the color of a brewed Darjeeling tea, tea leaves, and the ability to hover your cursor to quickly add the tea to your cart right from the landing page is handy and avoids extra clicks. They provide a detailed description of each tea and tasting notes, and the lifecycle right from the plucked date through to processing, sorting, vacuum pad, storage and ready to ship date. Nice! 

As a customer, you can can provide comments and feedback for each tea, which is published at in the comments section at the button. However, I would be skeptical, as only positive comments are published. My last negative comment about a teaspoon I bought was not posted.

#### Tea Selection

As they deal directly with the ted estates (tea gardens), they always have a good inventory of tea and the selection was even better this year (2021). I saw some of my favourites second flushes, Giddhapahar, Margarets Hope, Castletonton, Jungpaana, and Seeyok on their website before any other sellers!

#### Tea Quality

Most of the tea that I’ve bought from Teabox has been excellent, with a few exceptions once in a while. 

#### Price

They are price competitive, but I noticed that this year prices are higher. Also, their courier service fee has also increased quite a bit, which adds to your overall cost. However, if you purchase over $100, you quality for free shipping.

You can pay using your credit card or PayPal

#### Courier and Packaging

The teas are vacuum packed and storage pouches are provided for each tea you buy. They have minimal packaging and marketing materials, which I love. You can track your parcel and the delivery is always on time. Also, you don’t have to pay any import tax/fees.

#### Customer Service

Excellent customer service. Prompt response.

## Capital Tea

My first experience with Capital Tea  was disappointing as they misplaced my parcel and the delivery was delayed. I didn’t have any tea to drink for an entire 48 hours - imagine! Having said that, they are fine tea importers based in Toronto and my overall experience has been pretty good so far.

#### Website

They have a simple website, but it’s easy to navigate and find the products. The “New Arrivals” option is useful to quickly check what’s new on their inventory. I also love the drag and drop option to quickly add tea to your cart directly from the landing page.

#### Tea Inventory

They hold a decent variety of tea sources from the popular tea estates in Darjeeling. I usually buy my favourites such as Casteleon and Margaret's Hope from them. As they are based in Toronto, they do not always keep up with the latest seasonal batch. However, it’s always handy to have a good quality of inventory just a few hours away from where you live.

#### Tea Quality

Most of the tea that I’ve bought from Capital TEa has been excellent, with a few exceptions when I ventured out to lesser known tea estates.

#### Price and Payment

They are price competitive and cheaper than Teabox and Vahdam Tea given that their shipping fees are much lower. Also, if you purchase over CAD$60, shipping is free within Canada.

You can pay using your credit card or by calling them on the phone.

#### Courier and Packaging

The teas are packed and sent in a sealed storage pouch. They have minimal packaging and marketing materials, which I love. You can track your parcel and the delivery is on time. 

#### Customer Service

Not the best customer service. Their response time is really slow and you can never reaching them on phone.

## Vahdam Teas

Vahdam Teas is a Noida based retailer and exporter of fine teas. I started buying from them this year (2021) and my experience has been good so far other than the import tax I had to pay, which they resolved quickly.

#### Website

While they have a modern looking website, I am not a fan of their navigation and especially the inability to filter Darjeeling’s tea variety (first flush vs second flush). I only drink second flush and like the way you can quickly filter the type on Teabox and Capital Tea’s website, Vahdam’s website does not have that option. This means scrolling and paying attention to each and every black teas in their inventory. They do highlight new arrivals with a tag, but still, not helpful when you have to keep scrolling. If anyone from Vahdam Teas is reading this article, you guys really need to work on adding a filter and working on improving the navigation. Obviously, if you guys need help, you can always reach out to me.

Also, you have to click a couple of times to add a tea to your cart, not the best experience. As compared to Teabox and Capital team where you have the options to buy 100 grams or more, I have only seen 100 grams with Vahdam Teas. 

#### Tea Inventory

They have a good variety of tea in their inventory, but scrolling through all the teas they have in their inventory is painful (more whines about their website). 

#### Tea Quality

My first experience has been great. I recently bought Okayti, Jungpana, and Margaret's Hope second flushes from them and all the teas were excellent. I will be writing more about these teas later.

#### Price and Payment

They are price competitive and cheaper than Teabox given that their shipping fees is much lower. 

You can pay using your credit card or by calling them on the phone.

#### Courier and Packaging

The teas are vacuum packed and storage pouches are provided for each tea you buy. I was not impressed with the unnecessary packaging and marketing material that was included in the parcel. I guess that’s the reason why I had to pay the import tax. You can track your parcel and the delivery was on time. Also, you don’t have to pay any import tax/fees.

#### Customer Service

Good customer service. I reached out to their customer service with my complaints about having to pay a high import tax and they quickly resolved it with a refund. On my next purchase I intended to ask them whether I will need to pay the import tax and what they are going to do about it.
